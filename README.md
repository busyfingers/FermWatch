# FermWatch
Visualization of beer fermentation data, built in Dash (Python) and uses BrewBack - https://github.com/busyfingers/BrewBack - to get the data.

Enter the values in config.py and it should be quite easy to startup. Please refer to the Dash documentation for how to install those dependencies. Tested on Python 3.6 and 3.7.

*Note:* The script assumes that there are sensor data for two locations called "Bucket" and "Ambient". These can be modified to suit your specific setup.
